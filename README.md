# TaskMaster(Treasure Hacks 3.0)

### Inspiration

Our inspiration for this project were productivity apps like Habitica,
which allows you to create quests and daily tasks for yourself,
and get rewarded with coins, levels, and equipment for completing them.
These apps are usually in the theme of an RPG, a Role Playing Game.
We decided to instead have a system where you could buy powerups
for your coins.

### How our project was built

Our project is built with flet for the graphical user interface, and firebase for the storage of user logins and scores in the cloud.

We first built the base to-do list, then added features for setting 
a time for a task, logging in, and keeping track of and receiving currency.


### Project features
* To-do list.
* Productivity meter.
* Custom time limits for each task. Task can be paused but can not be checked off before the timer runs out.

* Login system stored in the cloud.

### Obstacles
A major obstacle we ran into was that at one point, for one member of the team,
certain modules kept repeating the same error, allowing nothing else to run for them.
This took a fairly significant time to try to troubleshoot, which ultimately failed,
not allowing that member to contribute more code to the project.

### Future plans
For the future, we would implement a system of currency, with which
you would be able to buy powerups and a variety of purchasable rewards from a shop, a 
leaderboard to compete with your friends, and an options menu with
selectable themes.

* Coin rewards for completing tasks.
* Coin shop for powerups and rewards.
